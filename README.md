# limn
A graphical esoteric language, inspired by [Charcoal](https://github.com/somebody1234/Charcoal) and [<><(Fish)](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Fish).

The idea behind limn is to create a self modifying language that can create images and ascii art, using the same controls needed to create those things.

For now, I plan on using p5.js to simplify the creation of graphical output.
