# limn
A graphical esoteric language, inspired by [Charcoal](https://github.com/somebody1234/Charcoal) and [<><(Fish)](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Fish).

The idea behind limn is to create a self modifying language that can create images and ascii art, using the same controls needed to create those things.

## Implemented functionality:

#### Code canvas
* Pushing Strings and Numbers to stack
* Setting direction using arrow commands
* Rotating cursor direction by 45&deg; and 90&deg;
* Choosing a random direction
* Tokenizing an arrow string
* Retrieving data in place
* Self modifying printing
* Conditionals
* Warping
